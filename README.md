# Download Deleted Twitch Vods

Requirements:
- Hashlib. install if you don't have it
- Datetime. install if you don't have it
- Python 3+
 

Once you have all requirements installed, run the script and enter the info it needs (streamer name, vod ID, start timestamp of stream) and it will return a url. Feed this url into VLC's network stream 
and you can now view deleted vods. Twitch needs to patch this very quickly.
